# Binary Search Tree (BST)
A binary Search Tree is a binary tree where
the value of any node is greater than the left
subtree and less than the right subtree.

# Properties
    - All nodes of the left subtree are less than the root node and nodes of the right subtree are greater than the root node;

    - The inOrder traversal fo BSTs give the values in ascending order;

    - All the subtrees of a BST hold the same properties.
