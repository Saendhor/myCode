# Radix Sort
Radix Sort is a linear sorting algorithm that sorts elements by processing them digit by digit.
It is an efficient sorting algorithm for integers or strings with fixed-size keys.

Rather than comparing elements directly, Radix Sort distributes the elements into buckets based on each digit’s value.
By repeatedly sorting the elements by their significant digits, from the least significant to the most significant, Radix Sort achieves the final sorted order.

        for i ← 1 to d
            stable sorting algorithm to order A based on digit i
